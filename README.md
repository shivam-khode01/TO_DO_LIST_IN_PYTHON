# TO_DO_LIST_IN_PYTHON
Creating a python projec to maintain the work life balance and to remember the task and its due date.
Creating a command-line to-do list application in Python with task management features, priority system, due dates, list view, and data persistence can be a rewarding project. Below, I'll outline the key components and steps to create such an application:

**1. Task Management:**
   - Create a `Todo` class to represent individual tasks. Include attributes like `name`, `priority`, `due_date`, and `completed`.

**2. Priority System:**
   - Implement a priority system, where tasks can be categorized as high, medium, or low priority.

**3. Due Dates:**
   - Allow users to set due dates for tasks. You can use Python's `datetime` module to handle date-related operations.

**4. List View:**
   - Design a user-friendly list view to display tasks along with their details. You can use formatting to make the list more readable.

**5. Task Management Functions:**
   - Implement functions for adding tasks, removing tasks, and marking tasks as completed. Ensure error handling for invalid inputs.

**6. Data Persistence:**
   - To store tasks for persistence across sessions, you can use either file handling or a simple database library like SQLite, depending on your preference and the complexity of your project.

   - **File Handling (Using `pickle` or Plain Text):**
     - Create functions to save tasks to a file and load tasks from the file. You can use the `pickle` module to serialize and deserialize task data.

     - Example functions:
       - `save_tasks_to_file(tasks, filename)`: Save tasks to a file (e.g., in JSON or pickle format).
       - `load_tasks_from_file(filename)`: Load tasks from a file when the application starts.

   - **Simple Database (Using SQLite):**
     - If you choose to use a database, install the `sqlite3` library and create a SQLite database file to store task data.

     - Implement functions for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using SQL commands. For example:
       - `create_task(task)`: Insert a new task into the database.
       - `read_tasks()`: Retrieve all tasks from the database.
       - `update_task(task_id, updated_task)`: Update an existing task.
       - `delete_task(task_id)`: Delete a task.

**7. Command-Line Interface (CLI):**
   - Build a user-friendly command-line interface for users to interact with the application. Use libraries like `argparse` for parsing command-line arguments.

**8. Menu System:**
   - Create a menu system that presents options for adding, removing, completing, and displaying tasks. Users can navigate through these options using numeric selections.

**9. User Input Validation:**
   - Ensure that user inputs are validated and handled gracefully. For example, check for valid dates, numeric input, and task indices.

**10. User Feedback:**
    - Provide clear and informative feedback to users after each action. Display success messages, error messages, and task lists.

**11. Testing:**
    - Thoroughly test your application to ensure it functions as expected. Write unit tests for critical functions and edge cases.

**12. Documentation:**
    - Create documentation for your application, including a user guide that explains how to use it.

**13. Error Handling:**
    - Implement robust error handling to prevent crashes and provide helpful error messages to users.

**14. Finalize and Package:**
    - Once your application is complete, package it for distribution. You can use tools like `pyinstaller` to create standalone executables if needed.

**15. Distribution:**
    - Share your to-do list application with others by hosting it on a version control platform (e.g., GitHub) or distributing it through package managers like `pip` if you create a Python package.

Remember that the complexity of this project can vary based on your specific requirements and your familiarity with Python and database systems. You can start with a basic version and gradually add more features and improvements as you become more comfortable with the development process.
